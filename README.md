# GameLog API

This is a small API project built to experiment with **[FastEndpoints](https://fast-endpoints.com/)**.

The API is designed to manage a personal video game backlog : letting you track which games you're playing, have completed, dropped, or plan to play.  
You can also rate and review the games, and store the dates you started or finished them.
