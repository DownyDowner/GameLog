# GameLog

This is a small project where I experiment with **[FastEndpoints](https://fast-endpoints.com/)** for the backend and **[React](https://react.dev/)** for the frontend.

On the backend, FastEndpoints is used to build a simple API for managing a personal video game backlog. It allows you to track which games you're playing, have completed, dropped, or plan to play. You can also rate and review the games, and store the dates you started or finished them.

On the frontend, I am experimenting with React to create an interactive interface that will communicate with the backend API, offering a user-friendly way to manage the game backlog.
