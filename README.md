# GameLog

**GameLog** is a personal web app where I share my video game recommendations in a blog-style format. It serves as both a public space to showcase games I enjoy and a private dashboard to track my current gaming activity.

## ✨ Features

- 💬 **Game Recommendation Blog**: Browse through entries where I review, rate, and recommend games I've played.
- 🎮 **Progress Tracker**: Keep track of the games I'm currently playing, have completed, paused, or dropped.
- 🛠️ **Admin Interface**: A private admin section allows me to easily update my game list, write new reviews, and log play sessions.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: [FastEndpoints](https://fast-endpoints.com/) (built on ASP.NET) for a clean and performant API.
- **Frontend**: [React](https://react.dev/) for a dynamic, responsive user experience.

## 🚧 Purpose

This project is a personal playground for experimenting with modern technologies while curating a digital log of my gaming life. It’s continuously evolving as I add new features and improve the experience.
